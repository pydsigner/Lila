Fleshing out a simple protocol sent in line buffered JSON

Dependancies:
    -Twisted
    -Redis Server
    -PyRedis

Protocol:
    Everything is a json dumped dict.

    Connection
    Client -> Server: {"USER":username, "PASS":password}
    if auth:
        Server -> Client: {"STATUS":"OK"}
    else (after 25 seconds or failed login):
        Server -> Client: {"STATUS" : "REJECTED"}

    Every 25 seconds
    Server -> Client: {"PING":uid}
    Client -> Server: {"PONG": same uid}
    if fail or timeout:
        {"STATUS" : "REJECTED", "INFO" : "Did not reply to last ping."}
    else:
        repeat 25 seconds later
